# ü§ì About me
Hello there! I'm Erik Miedes, a Computer Engineer with a major in Computing from [@UPC](https://github.com/UPC), passionate about solving complex problems through clever and efficient algorithms, sometimes crafting my own when none quite fit.

I currently work at [@Telefonica](https://github.com/Telefonica), building robust management and administration solutions, as well as resilient, scalable APIs that handle hundreds to thousands of requests per second.

Clean, maintainable code is not just a goal but a necessity for me. Over time, I've grown a deep appreciation for software architecture. I strive to design systems that feel inevitable: where every abstraction, every interface, every package falls naturally into place.

I'm driven by a constant urge to learn, craft better software, and eventually lead as a technical voice within my organization.

Coding is an art form. When the code is clear, expressive, and Sonar remains silent... that‚Äôs when I truly smile.

# üå® Get to know me better
- I'm deeply passionate about meteorology, especially severe weather. But there is one special thing I love: snow ‚ùÑÔ∏è.
Not skiing, not snowboarding... just snow falling. There's something magical about it that‚Äôs fascinated me since I was a kid. Growing up in Barcelona, Spain, where snow is rare, made every flake feel like an event.
These days, I spend hours analyzing weather models, calculating snow levels, and chasing even the faintest chance of flurries That lack of certainty is definitely half the thrill.
I'm exploring the idea of building a custom tool to calculate snow lines, because why not mix coding and clouds?
- Music keeps me in the flow. When I‚Äôm coding, I usually have some EDM, OST, or Spanish indie playing in the background.
